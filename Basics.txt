Linux actually is not a operating system but a kernel upon which operating systems are built.
Kali Linux, Ubuntu, Parrot OS are some examples of OS built using the Linux kernel.

What is a kernel?? - It is a software that acts as an interface between applications and hardware.
It performs functions like memory management, disk management etc.

Linux based OS are the most widely used in the world. It is less vulnerable than windows and is open source i.e. 
it is free for modification and distribution. Linux provides high performance to it's users and is less memory 
hungry. It is especially famous in the hacking community because of the various hacking tools that are 
available on Linux.

From here on out we will use Linux based OS and Linux interchangebly
because it's easier to say Linux than to refer to Linux Based OS all the time.

In Linux everything is in a file format(even hardware components like your hard disk). Even the commands we
use are stored as files.
