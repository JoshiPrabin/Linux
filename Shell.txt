Linux offers a good GUI for the ease of users which some people may prefer but that is not how Linux is
supposed to be used. To navigate around we use something called a shell. A shell (also called terminal or
 command line) provides an interface between the kernel and the user. We have more freedom using the shell 
 than the GUI because of the many things we can play around with. It gives us many possibilities to 
 interact with programs and is also a faster means of getting information.

 The most commonly used shell in Linux is the BASH(Bourne-Again Shell).
