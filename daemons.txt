Let us first try to understand what processes are in Linux.
Processes are an instance of a running program. Example:When you open sublime. When you open a certain program
that provides some service, you've basically started a process.

Daemons are the processes that are running in the background to provide services to the end-user.
Example: Networking daemon, SSH daemon, printing daemon etc.
Systemd is the master daemon process that controls(starting,stoping,restarting) all other daemon processes.
Systemd is a service manager and a initialization system.

Some useful commands: 
process status = ps -aux
to stop a process = systemctl stop <process name>
to see status = systemctl status <pricess name>
to start a process = systemctl start <process name>
to restart a process = systemctl restart <process name>
(pretty self explanatory)  systemctl reload-or-restart <process name>
to disable a process =  systemctl disbale <process name>
to enable a process =  systemctl enable <process name>
to check if it is active = systemctl is-active <process name>
to check if it is enabled = systemctl is-enabled <process name>
to see the daemons that systemd knows about = systemctl list-units

Systemctl is a command line tool that we use to control the daemons
